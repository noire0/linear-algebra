## Example
Run compile.sh or compile manually example.f. Running the program in a terminal 
will ask you for a filename with data, that filename will be example.txt, but 
could be any file you like. It has a character limit so change it to len=*
(where you can) or big enough for your filenames.

## Array Slicing Example
The array slicing example doesn't need the library, but it proves useful for 
anyone working with arrays. Keep this example in mind for modern fortran. 

## Eigen-polynomial coefficients
It asks for a filename, data in the file should be a square matrix. Uses matrix.
txt by default.
