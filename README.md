# linear-algebra
Linear algebra for Fortran, a library of matrix and vector operations that isn't fixed to a number of rows or columns.

## Example
Run compile.sh or compile manually example.f. Running the program in a terminal will ask you for a filename with data, that filename will be example.txt, but could be any file you like. It has a character limit so change it to len=* (where you can) or big enough for your filenames.

## Array Slicing Example
The array slicing example doesn't need the library, but it proves useful for anyone working with arrays. Keep this example in mind for modern fortran.
