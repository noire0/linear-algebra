# linear-algebra
Linear algebra for Fortran, a library of matrix and vector operations that isn't fixed to a number of rows or columns.
## Example
The array slicing example doesn't need the library, but it proves useful for anyone working with arrays. Keep this example in mind for modern fortran. Run compile.sh or compile manually example.f. Running the program in a terminal will ask you for a filename with data, that filename will be example.txt, but could be another you like. It has a character limit so change it to len=* or make the limit bigger for bigger filenames.
